## CV Scores for Models
Linear Regression: 0.769175
Lasso: 0.866028
Ridge: 0.867483

## Alpha Scores
Lasso: 0.995896
Ridge: 0.976371

## Model Preformance Cross Val Scores
Lasso: 0.76988
Ridge: 0.76996


The Ridge model performs better overall. The Lasso model is cause for concern because of the convergence warning. Also the CV scores are slightly lower in the Lasso model. This analysis is limited by the ability to do only 100 iterations and the lack of new testing data.
